# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Model

## Objective
Build a regression model to predict car prices using technical and categorical features. This project demonstrates how to prepare data and use machine learning for practical business use cases.

## Dataset Overview
- Includes attributes like brand, year, fuel type, transmission, engine volume, mileage, etc.
- Target variable: Selling price

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
- Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, removed duplicates
- Conducted EDA and visualized feature relationships (correlation matrix, pairplots)
- Encoded categorical variables using label encoding
- Trained a linear regression model and evaluated it using RMSE & RÂ² score

## Key Insights
- Car age, mileage, and engine volume are strong predictors of price
- Automatic transmission and diesel fuel types had higher average selling prices
- Car brand and fuel type show clear impact on price range

## Outcome
Built a baseline regression model that gives interpretable results and helps stakeholders understand how different features affect car prices.

## Files Included
- `car_price_model.ipynb`: Cleaned and well-commented notebook with full ML pipeline
